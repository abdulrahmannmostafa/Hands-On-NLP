Q1:

It represents the number of keys we have embeddings for each


Q2:

The dimensionality for each key's embedding is (300 x 1)


Predicted Country:
Egypt

Predicted Similarity:
0.7626821994781494

Q3:

Yes


Q4:

Yes. Because the embedding itself stores the meaning of the word, for that all words with the same context with utlilzing the concept of DISTRIBUTIONAL HYPOTHESIS, this would likely mean that all words with the same
context should be clustered together as they have the same meaning. For that if we make a difference between a country and its city, then that value would be nearly equal any difference between other country and its city
So, The difference between a country and its capital tends to form a consistent direction in embedding space across many examples. 
Since this relation stays roughly the same, we can reuse the vector difference from one pair (city1 → country1) to predict the country corresponding to another city (city2).

Q5:

Type Yes or No
YES


Q6:

Type your answer here
Similar words are each clustered together (happy,sad) are very close, sad is a bit further and this applies for all other similar words. this happens due to similarity in the directions of vectors.
